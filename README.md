# Seasonal Quote Generator

OpenClassrooms Front-End Developer path project: 'Create a quotation generator'.

## Introduction
This is the code for a quote generator with seasonal quotes. Each quote consists of 3 parts that are randomly chosen from a list of possibilities. The user can choose between 1 and 5 quotes (all different) in either an Autumn or Winter theme.

It's based on a brief, which can be found in the documents folder above. 

There are 3 JS versions (the first 2 based on the brief, the last one I added myself): 
* Version 1 is the most basic one with only 1 theme (Autumn) and for each part of the quote only 3 possibilities. It runs in the console.
* Version 2 has both themes, more possibilities (4-5) for each quote part, and the option for the user to choose between 1 and 5 quotes. It also runs in the console.
* Version 3 is the final solution with more variation and a UI that runs in the browser. 

## Technologies
The technologies used are:
* HTML 5 / CSS 3
* Bootstrap 4
* Vanilla JavaScript

## Setup
To run this project yourself: 
* clone to your local machine 
* in index.html choose which JS version you want to see by uncommenting this version and commenting out the other versions
